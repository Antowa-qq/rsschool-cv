## Summary :
I am a young beginner specialist. I strive to reveal myself in the field of programming, in particular a full-stack developer. During this lesson I do not notice the hours until I bring the work to its logical conclusion. Courses are very important to me, as I set a goal to find a place where I will be useful. I also hope to chat with interesting and smart people. I will do everything in my power!
